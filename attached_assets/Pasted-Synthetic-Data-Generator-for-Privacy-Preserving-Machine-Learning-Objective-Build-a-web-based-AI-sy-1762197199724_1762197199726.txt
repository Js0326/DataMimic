Synthetic Data Generator for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning

Objective:
Build a web-based AI system that generates synthetic datasets preserving the statistical properties and ML utility of original datasets while ensuring data privacy and anonymity.

🌐 Project Overview

The system allows users to upload real-world CSV datasets (e.g., health, finance, demographics), choose a generation model, and obtain a synthetic dataset that mimics the real one without exposing sensitive records.
It provides visual analytics, privacy metrics, and downloadable outputs for easy use in ML training and research.

💻 Key Features

Upload CSV Dataset – User uploads a dataset via web UI

Model Selection – Choose from:

Gaussian Copula (probabilistic model)

CTGAN (deep generative model)

Differentially Private GAN (optional)

Synthetic Data Generation – Backend ML engine creates new synthetic data

Evaluation Dashboard – Compare synthetic vs. real data:

Summary statistics

Correlation heatmap

Distribution comparison plots

Privacy metrics (e.g., Mutual Information, nearest neighbor distance)

Download Center – Download synthetic dataset (.csv) and PDF summary report

Auto Report Generator – Generates performance summary (utility & privacy scores)
